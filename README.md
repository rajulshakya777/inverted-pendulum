# inverted-pendulum
Inverted pendulum is an application of PID algorithm in laboratory.Controlling of inverted pendulum using arduino uno can be implementd by using the following physical equipments-
Encoder,Arduino uno,High speed motor(arround 6000 or higher rpm),Pendulum and a Physical model given in .jpg file.Desired response of the system
is obtained by tunnig the system for the most suitable values of PID algorithm(block diagram of PID algorithm is given in .jpg file) constants.
